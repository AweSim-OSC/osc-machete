# OSC::Machete

Ruby AweSim app kit code to help with staging and checking the status of batch jobs.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'osc-machete', :path => "/nfs/17/efranz/dev/osc-machete"

And then execute:

    $ bundle install --local


Or, clone the repo into your home directory and change the path in your gem file to point to this directory.

**Note: these are not the right directions yet for AweSim developers. Once we have an initial version, we will tag it and then install it as a gem on Glenn. Then users can use it by simply gem 'osc-machete' to use the latest one installed or specify a version that is installed.**
